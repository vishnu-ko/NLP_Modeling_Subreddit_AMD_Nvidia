(Excerpted from: https://www.tomshardware.com/news/fpga-demo-shows-efficiency-gains-compared-to-x86-chip )

""The FPGA (opens in new tab) in question is the Arty A7 (opens in new tab), a Xilinx Artix-7 100T FPGA development board that sells for around $280 and features 101,440 logic cells (an FPGA’s logic cells contain a look-up table that can implement any logic function, giving the chip its programmability) on a 28 nanometer process, and which pulls less than a watt of power. The CPU it was pitted against (without, it must be said, troubling the chip’s iGPU) was a Ryzen 7 4800H, an eight-core 16-thread laptop processor that was built on a 7 nm process and has a default TDP of 45W. That's a laptop chip that's not available on its own, but the R7 4700G is currently available for about $240.

The game that was compiled to run on the two very different platforms is ""Sphery Vs Shapes,"" and doesn’t appear to contain much in the way of plot, characters or actual gameplay, but does have lots of ray-tracing, as a shiny metallic ball bounces its way across a chessboard-like environment, which is reflected in its shiny spherical surface.

Both platforms rendered the game at 1080p and 60 frames per second without a problem, but the FPGA did it using 660 mW, while the R7 needed 35W, a difference of 53x. It is speculated that, were the FPGA to use the same 7nm process as the CPU, this figure could be six times higher.""

TLDR: FPGA here rendered demo video game with 53x performance per watt vs Ryzen r7 apu.  The paper used a xilinx FPGA, AMD acquired xilinx and intends to integrate FPGA acceleration with Zen 5.",Amd,A peekkind of performance potential Zen 5 FPGA integration may offer

dvcspl,1664493812,xrm4et,True,"Just upgraded today to 7900X/X670E Crosshair/GSkill DDR5 6000 EXPO CL30 from 5900X/Crosshair 8 Hero/GSkill DDR4 3600 CL16. Once you get up and going the system is snappy! No major issues so far other than some sort of USB issue where I had too many audio devices on one USB lane. Swapped ports and it's all good now - but BOOT TIME!

On first boot, it takes like 3-4 minutes of memory training all while just sitting there wondering if it's going to POST. After it finally posted I was hit with the Windows TPM thing (didn't do a fresh install.. I know, I know...) so I reset the fTPM, re-linked Windows 11 and I was in. Updated some drivers and whatnot and shut down to perform a clean boot. 

Even still, it's 1-2 minutes to get to Windows. Almost 50 seconds before you see the ROG bios logo. Then I thought I should update the BIOS to see if it helps. Mine shipped with 0410 - 8/22/22 and the latest non-beta BIOS is 0611. Updated, got a few new features. Something called ""PBO Enhancement"" which automatically applies a core offset depending on your workload, or so I'm guessing. Still a lot of options that are there with no explanation. New hardware problems I guess. 

Hoping they improve the boot time for sure.. I saw TechPowerUp said the same thing in their review. ([https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-9-7900x/28.html](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/amd-ryzen-9-7900x/28.html))

The 7700X, in my opinion, is a flop. It performs worse than the 5800X3D in general, and performs significantly worse in simulators due to the lack of 3D V-cache.

I've spent hours learning anything that I could do to fix this problem. UV/OC, every windows setting, registry, full windows install, DDU, everything. I have tried every driver possible, some better than others but always come back to the same crash.

Currently on  22.5.1 but recently  going back and forth. A couple months ago the crashes got so bad that I couldn't even open a browser and watch a YT video. Anyways, I came across a post about Microsoft GameInput and how it clashes with the AMD drivers and times out. So I uninstall this program and its been about 3 months without a crash, not even a hiccup.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

Now I know it's a bottom of the barrel last gen Cezanne chip with the graphics portion disabled, but it's also on 7nm, and it's 6 core / 12 thread and eats the 3570k (even overclocked to 4+GHz) for breakfast out of the box. I'm waiting on an AM4 mounting kit for my Dark Rock Pro 3 cooler and then the fun will begin. I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

I'm waiting on an AM4 mounting kit for my Dark Rock Pro 3 cooler and then the fun will begin. I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

I'm waiting on an AM4 mounting kit for my Dark Rock Pro 3 cooler and then the fun will begin. I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

Was thinking the 5800x3D but I'm totally open to other suggestions.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

The current content of that section is completely useless since it only affects DX9,10, and early DX 11 games.  
Just having an SMAA option would allow you to replace the useless Anti Aliasing section.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

Nvidia has these features built in, and you used to be able to implement them transparently with RadeonPro.  
But AMD hired the RadeonPro Dev to play to develop Raptr, which was removed from the driver a few months later.

It'd would just simply be amazing if we could inject FSR, SMAA, SSAO, color balancing, noise, directly from the ""Graphics Settings tab"".  
The current content of that section is completely useless since it only affects DX9,10, and early DX 11 games.  
Just having an SMAA option would allow you to replace the useless Anti Aliasing section.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset.

Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

ramy_chaos,1664411459,xqt8mv,True,"Hi everyone! So, I upgraded my pc last year when the 5600 was just out and got the 3700x. Now, I'm thinking of selling the cpu and upgrading to something in the 5 series. Is it worth it?
Also, what would the recommended upgrade cpu be? Currently, its primarily heavy gaming at 1440p and occasionally music production, but I might be getting into video production soon for a project, not a full time job, at least initially 😅 

Was thinking the 5800x3D but I'm totally open to other suggestions.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

Linkin1993,1664461091,xr91m1,True,"To a Ryzen 5500. Now I know it's a bottom of the barrel last gen Cezanne chip with the graphics portion disabled, but it's also on 7nm, and it's 6 core / 12 thread and eats the 3570k (even overclocked to 4+GHz) for breakfast out of the box. I'm waiting on an AM4 mounting kit for my Dark Rock Pro 3 cooler and then the fun will begin. I intend to safely squeeze every last drop of performance out of it for now, and upgrade to a better AM4 chip in the future


DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware. Literally all I did was use my pc for games, replaced the GPU from GTX570 to Titan to 980 Ti and a power supply replacement around then.",Amd,Just upgraded from a 3570k to a Ryzen 5500.

But AMD hired the RadeonPro Dev to play to develop Raptr, which was removed from the driver a few months later.

It'd would just simply be amazing if we could inject FSR, SMAA, SSAO, color balancing, noise, directly from the ""Graphics Settings tab"".  
The current content of that section is completely useless since it only affects DX9,10, and early DX 11 games.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation. Thank you all for your time today!",Amd,Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W. As far as my knowledge reaches this number is actually the generation of heat and not the actual power usage.

SenseiLeNoir,1664463489,xr9zim,True,"Note I am writing about my own experience and personal circunstances, your own mileage may vary, so please dont angrily reply saying that I am wrong, as you have a different experience in your own circumstances. This ""post"" is just to advise those who may be in a similar boat to me.

I am a software developer who regularly develops and builds java ""enterprise"" applications, and runs VMs (both WSL and discrete linux). I also do a lot of photo editing (lightroom + large raw files from my DSLR), and general video editing (mainly quick joining and cutting of HVEC 4k files form my phone/DSLR and occasional productions).

And I play games (Flight Simulator, other sims, and some FPS/Casual).

My computer usage is mainly productivity, and casual (web/youtube/movies/home admin)

One would assume looking at the above, and reading many reviews from Toms Hardware that I would benefit more from a high core 5950X, or even a Zen 4 7950X for my productivity workloads as they tend to show better improvements in some productivity, rather than the more gaming oriented 5800X3D.

The reason boiled down to my own ""Real World"" usage patterns, and the cost to benefit ratios I deemed.

Whilst other CPUs may be faster in compiling/video processing/image processing/cinebench than the 5800X3D, the fact is:

1. Those stages are less than 5% of the time using my computer. When when coding, 95% of the time is actually writing code, and less than 2% is actually compiling in my typical Java workflow. a faster CPU does not effect my hands typing code! (even an 1500X is plenty responsive enough)
2. The most CPU intensive stage, (Compile/render/etc), is at most probably about 2-5% of my overall workflow time, and only gains a few seconds. Even when the odd occasion where I am rendering a large video project a difference of 19mins vs 18 mins is really not significant in the big picture. If i was continously rendering such files (80% of my workflow time, or more) then I may have to consider a high core processor (and GPU)
3. for most times I am using my PC (clicking around, reading/typing/manipulating stuff on the screen) most modern CPUs are reasonably similar.
4. The 5800x3D idles more efficiently (for me)

What was an issue for me was small stuttering whilst playing MSFS 2020, and other games, which the 5800X3D massively and noticably improved.

As such I chose this CPU despite not being a productivity king, because whilst it is a tad slower, it didnt really make an appreciatable difference for my workflows, but the difference in gaming was more significant. and it was a much ""cheaper"" upgrade than going for Zen 4 which would cost at minimum a new CPU/MB/RAM (maybe PSU) for what in my total time would be little benefit. 

The take home here is, always consider your total expected usage of your computer and when considering benchmarks, consider how it will effect you, and what compromises you are willing to expect. Even if your primary usage is productivity, carefully cosider where the performance increases actually benefit you in a meaningful way.

DDR4 3200 is also a nice improvement from DDR3 2400, with nicer timings as well.


Oh and I had one hell of a time getting my 980Ti to play nicely with the B550 chipset. First I had to take the card to get the DisplayPort firmware updated (remember that?) and then it was able to POST reliably, but still, playing War Thunder for a few matches resulted in losing video signal and no POST. Had to reseat the card. Then flashed the GPU BIOS to the latest version and it's been stable since.


I was one of the people anxiously waiting for Bulldozer to be released, then when it flopped terribly I stopped paying attention to PC hardware.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W. As far as my knowledge reaches this number is actually the generation of heat and not the actual power usage.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W. As far as my knowledge reaches this number is actually the generation of heat and not the actual power usage.

It'd would just simply be amazing if we could inject FSR, SMAA, SSAO, color balancing, noise, directly from the ""Graphics Settings tab"".  
The current content of that section is completely useless since it only affects DX9,10, and early DX 11 games.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation. Thank you all for your time today!",Amd,Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W. As far as my knowledge reaches this number is actually the generation of heat and not the actual power usage.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation. Thank you all for your time today!",Amd,Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation. Thank you all for your time today!",Amd,Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation. Thank you all for your time today!",Amd,Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W.

Was thinking the 5800x3D but I'm totally open to other suggestions. 

Current specs:

GB Aorus Master x570
Ryzen 7 3700x

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force!

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W. As far as my knowledge reaches this number is actually the generation of heat and not the actual power usage.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation. Thank you all for your time today!",Amd,Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.

Nvidia has these features built in, and you used to be able to implement them transparently with RadeonPro.

It'd would just simply be amazing if we could inject FSR, SMAA, SSAO, color balancing, noise, directly from the ""Graphics Settings tab"".  
The current content of that section is completely useless since it only affects DX9,10, and early DX 11 games.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W. As far as my knowledge reaches this number is actually the generation of heat and not the actual power usage.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation. Thank you all for your time today!",Amd,Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W.

Nvidia has these features built in, and you used to be able to implement them transparently with RadeonPro.

It'd would just simply be amazing if we could inject FSR, SMAA, SSAO, color balancing, noise, directly from the ""Graphics Settings tab"".  
The current content of that section is completely useless since it only affects DX9,10, and early DX 11 games.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

I strongly welcome any corrections or improvements to my description of the pricing situation. Thank you all for your time today!",Amd,Ryzen 7950X versus 5950X. Here's the real-world platform price-to-performance we are living in: ~51% higher price for ~45% higher multicore performance.

I've got a question regarding the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE. I'm looking for power consumption numbers. Currently I run a AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X and the machine its in runs on about 150W of power. I'm curious how much I could lower this by upgrading to the AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE.

The AMD Ryzen™ 7 PRO 5750GE has a TDP of 35W and the AMD Ryzen™ 9 3900X has a TDP of 105W.

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

[7900x was taken for another project before testing could be completed. ](https://preview.redd.it/lj07lu8fsoq91.png?width=694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbd85f9ebb7063278ff694b6eab07ee61bc4b173)

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Tuned_Out,1664362303,xq9fy3,True,"Or don't if you already have.

AM5 motherboards are an insult and you shouldn't consider it, even as an early adopter.

How many of you are using 3xx boards from first gen AM4 to power 3000 or 5000 series CPUs?

Answer: 1% or none. Because in many cases, you can't. And in all cases, you shouldn't. 3xx motherboards were also ""meh"" but at least they weren't this overpriced. You may be making a mistake buying this first gen AM5 platform now...and why...the cost to performance on 5000series and alderlake is insanely better.

These new boards are not future proofing anything for a new platform and you're insane if you think they will. You're going to want a proper motherboard to utilize these new features properly when the next series comes out...but hey spend $500+ now for a board that almost doesn't suck and find out the other way later. Or buy a $300 board that looks like it came straight out of a gateway pc from 2005. If ya got the money to burn, more power to ya...but for most of us, please stop and think.

They're overpriced, offer feature sets that aren't necessary, barely supported, and not optimized in any way that will make any sense until the next series of motherboards are released. Hopefully at more sane pricing when these just prove to be temporary beta boards for a new platform.

By purchasing this latest gen from either AMD or Intel, you're part of this growing price inflation problem.

Good news: 5000 series is still a beast. Prices have fallen dramatically, and their amazing performance is proven. They also have rock solid motherboard offerings. This early DDR5 still needs to fall in price and there is way more room for their speed and timings to improve. pcie 5.0 is not useful to any of us who don't plan on blowing $1600 on a Jensen hype machine, and even then...only barely.

Crypto crashing has also bottomed out video card prices.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Tuned_Out,1664362303,xq9fy3,True,"Or don't if you already have.

AM5 motherboards are an insult and you shouldn't consider it, even as an early adopter.

How many of you are using 3xx boards from first gen AM4 to power 3000 or 5000 series CPUs?

Answer: 1% or none. Because in many cases, you can't. And in all cases, you shouldn't. 3xx motherboards were also ""meh"" but at least they weren't this overpriced. You may be making a mistake buying this first gen AM5 platform now...and why...the cost to performance on 5000series and alderlake is insanely better.

These new boards are not future proofing anything for a new platform and you're insane if you think they will. You're going to want a proper motherboard to utilize these new features properly when the next series comes out...but hey spend $500+ now for a board that almost doesn't suck and find out the other way later. Or buy a $300 board that looks like it came straight out of a gateway pc from 2005. If ya got the money to burn, more power to ya...but for most of us, please stop and think.

They're overpriced, offer feature sets that aren't necessary, barely supported, and not optimized in any way that will make any sense until the next series of motherboards are released. Hopefully at more sane pricing when these just prove to be temporary beta boards for a new platform.

By purchasing this latest gen from either AMD or Intel, you're part of this growing price inflation problem.

Good news: 5000 series is still a beast. Prices have fallen dramatically, and their amazing performance is proven. They also have rock solid motherboard offerings. This early DDR5 still needs to fall in price and there is way more room for their speed and timings to improve. pcie 5.0 is not useful to any of us who don't plan on blowing $1600 on a Jensen hype machine, and even then...only barely.

Crypto crashing has also bottomed out video card prices.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

AM5 motherboards are an insult and you shouldn't consider it, even as an early adopter.

How many of you are using 3xx boards from first gen AM4 to power 3000 or 5000 series CPUs?

Answer: 1% or none. Because in many cases, you can't. And in all cases, you shouldn't. 3xx motherboards were also ""meh"" but at least they weren't this overpriced. You may be making a mistake buying this first gen AM5 platform now...and why...the cost to performance on 5000series and alderlake is insanely better.

These new boards are not future proofing anything for a new platform and you're insane if you think they will. You're going to want a proper motherboard to utilize these new features properly when the next series comes out...but hey spend $500+ now for a board that almost doesn't suck and find out the other way later. Or buy a $300 board that looks like it came straight out of a gateway pc from 2005. If ya got the money to burn, more power to ya...but for most of us, please stop and think.

They're overpriced, offer feature sets that aren't necessary, barely supported, and not optimized in any way that will make any sense until the next series of motherboards are released. Hopefully at more sane pricing when these just prove to be temporary beta boards for a new platform.

By purchasing this latest gen from either AMD or Intel, you're part of this growing price inflation problem.

Good news: 5000 series is still a beast. Prices have fallen dramatically, and their amazing performance is proven. They also have rock solid motherboard offerings. This early DDR5 still needs to fall in price and there is way more room for their speed and timings to improve. pcie 5.0 is not useful to any of us who don't plan on blowing $1600 on a Jensen hype machine, and even then...only barely.

Crypto crashing has also bottomed out video card prices.

Now is the time to be celebrating amazing pricing of previous gen and taking advantage of stellar deals. Not promoting crazy price gouging of lackluster new releases.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Tuned_Out,1664362303,xq9fy3,True,"Or don't if you already have.

AM5 motherboards are an insult and you shouldn't consider it, even as an early adopter.

How many of you are using 3xx boards from first gen AM4 to power 3000 or 5000 series CPUs?

Answer: 1% or none. Because in many cases, you can't. And in all cases, you shouldn't. 3xx motherboards were also ""meh"" but at least they weren't this overpriced. You may be making a mistake buying this first gen AM5 platform now...and why...the cost to performance on 5000series and alderlake is insanely better.

These new boards are not future proofing anything for a new platform and you're insane if you think they will. You're going to want a proper motherboard to utilize these new features properly when the next series comes out...but hey spend $500+ now for a board that almost doesn't suck and find out the other way later. Or buy a $300 board that looks like it came straight out of a gateway pc from 2005. If ya got the money to burn, more power to ya...but for most of us, please stop and think.

They're overpriced, offer feature sets that aren't necessary, barely supported, and not optimized in any way that will make any sense until the next series of motherboards are released. Hopefully at more sane pricing when these just prove to be temporary beta boards for a new platform.

By purchasing this latest gen from either AMD or Intel, you're part of this growing price inflation problem.

Good news: 5000 series is still a beast. Prices have fallen dramatically, and their amazing performance is proven. They also have rock solid motherboard offerings. This early DDR5 still needs to fall in price and there is way more room for their speed and timings to improve. pcie 5.0 is not useful to any of us who don't plan on blowing $1600 on a Jensen hype machine, and even then...only barely.

Crypto crashing has also bottomed out video card prices.

Now is the time to be celebrating amazing pricing of previous gen and taking advantage of stellar deals. Not promoting crazy price gouging of lackluster new releases.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

AM5 motherboards are an insult and you shouldn't consider it, even as an early adopter.

How many of you are using 3xx boards from first gen AM4 to power 3000 or 5000 series CPUs?

Answer: 1% or none. Because in many cases, you can't. And in all cases, you shouldn't. 3xx motherboards were also ""meh"" but at least they weren't this overpriced. You may be making a mistake buying this first gen AM5 platform now...and why...the cost to performance on 5000series and alderlake is insanely better.

These new boards are not future proofing anything for a new platform and you're insane if you think they will. You're going to want a proper motherboard to utilize these new features properly when the next series comes out...but hey spend $500+ now for a board that almost doesn't suck and find out the other way later. Or buy a $300 board that looks like it came straight out of a gateway pc from 2005. If ya got the money to burn, more power to ya...but for most of us, please stop and think.

They're overpriced, offer feature sets that aren't necessary, barely supported, and not optimized in any way that will make any sense until the next series of motherboards are released. Hopefully at more sane pricing when these just prove to be temporary beta boards for a new platform.

By purchasing this latest gen from either AMD or Intel, you're part of this growing price inflation problem.

Good news: 5000 series is still a beast. Prices have fallen dramatically, and their amazing performance is proven. They also have rock solid motherboard offerings. This early DDR5 still needs to fall in price and there is way more room for their speed and timings to improve. pcie 5.0 is not useful to any of us who don't plan on blowing $1600 on a Jensen hype machine, and even then...only barely.

Crypto crashing has also bottomed out video card prices.

Now is the time to be celebrating amazing pricing of previous gen and taking advantage of stellar deals. Not promoting crazy price gouging of lackluster new releases.

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Tuned_Out,1664362303,xq9fy3,True,"Or don't if you already have.

AM5 motherboards are an insult and you shouldn't consider it, even as an early adopter.

How many of you are using 3xx boards from first gen AM4 to power 3000 or 5000 series CPUs?

Answer: 1% or none. Because in many cases, you can't. And in all cases, you shouldn't. 3xx motherboards were also ""meh"" but at least they weren't this overpriced. You may be making a mistake buying this first gen AM5 platform now...and why...the cost to performance on 5000series and alderlake is insanely better.

These new boards are not future proofing anything for a new platform and you're insane if you think they will. You're going to want a proper motherboard to utilize these new features properly when the next series comes out...but hey spend $500+ now for a board that almost doesn't suck and find out the other way later. Or buy a $300 board that looks like it came straight out of a gateway pc from 2005. If ya got the money to burn, more power to ya...but for most of us, please stop and think.

They're overpriced, offer feature sets that aren't necessary, barely supported, and not optimized in any way that will make any sense until the next series of motherboards are released. Hopefully at more sane pricing when these just prove to be temporary beta boards for a new platform.

By purchasing this latest gen from either AMD or Intel, you're part of this growing price inflation problem.

Good news: 5000 series is still a beast. Prices have fallen dramatically, and their amazing performance is proven. They also have rock solid motherboard offerings. This early DDR5 still needs to fall in price and there is way more room for their speed and timings to improve. pcie 5.0 is not useful to any of us who don't plan on blowing $1600 on a Jensen hype machine, and even then...only barely.

Crypto crashing has also bottomed out video card prices.

Now is the time to be celebrating amazing pricing of previous gen and taking advantage of stellar deals. Not promoting crazy price gouging of lackluster new releases.

Okay, coffee rant over. Let the downvotes commence! &lt;3",Amd,"Seriously, this is a price to performance nightmare. Ignore this Gen and just upgrade to 5000 series if you haven't already."

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

I recently upgraded from FX6300 to R5600x and since this is fairly new stuff for me I have some questions.  


When idling HWinfo64 reports the idle frequency to be 3600MHz. The only way I can drop this to 3300MHZ is if I choose Power sawing option in Windows. (Picture attached)  


Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

Thanks in advance.

Hifihedgehog,1664396851,xqnfk1,True,"&gt; For productivity the 7950x, even including board and ram prices, offers some of the best price to performance available, while also offering unmatched performance.

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it. AMD is in for a rude awakening come their next quarterly investment call *unless* they and their motherboard partners drastically slash prices between now and the revenue-critical holiday shopping season.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

AM5 motherboards are an insult and you shouldn't consider it, even as an early adopter.

How many of you are using 3xx boards from first gen AM4 to power 3000 or 5000 series CPUs?

Answer: 1% or none. Because in many cases, you can't. And in all cases, you shouldn't. 3xx motherboards were also ""meh"" but at least they weren't this overpriced. You may be making a mistake buying this first gen AM5 platform now...and why...the cost to performance on 5000series and alderlake is insanely better.

These new boards are not future proofing anything for a new platform and you're insane if you think they will. You're going to want a proper motherboard to utilize these new features properly when the next series comes out...but hey spend $500+ now for a board that almost doesn't suck and find out the other way later. Or buy a $300 board that looks like it came straight out of a gateway pc from 2005. If ya got the money to burn, more power to ya...but for most of us, please stop and think.

They're overpriced, offer feature sets that aren't necessary, barely supported, and not optimized in any way that will make any sense until the next series of motherboards are released. Hopefully at more sane pricing when these just prove to be temporary beta boards for a new platform.

By purchasing this latest gen from either AMD or Intel, you're part of this growing price inflation problem.

Good news: 5000 series is still a beast. Prices have fallen dramatically, and their amazing performance is proven. They also have rock solid motherboard offerings. This early DDR5 still needs to fall in price and there is way more room for their speed and timings to improve. pcie 5.0 is not useful to any of us who don't plan on blowing $1600 on a Jensen hype machine, and even then...only barely.

Crypto crashing has also bottomed out video card prices.

Now is the time to be celebrating amazing pricing of previous gen and taking advantage of stellar deals. Not promoting crazy price gouging of lackluster new releases.

Okay, coffee rant over. Let the downvotes commence! &lt;3",Amd,"Seriously, this is a price to performance nightmare. Ignore this Gen and just upgrade to 5000 series if you haven't already."

However, the cpu is what is giving me a little bit of trouble. I'm looking to go up to the pretty high end of new pc components.

I'm looking to get some opinions on what people think would be the best option for my kind of use case. Would resizable bar make up the difference in gaming performance that intel might have when it comes to the 13900k? I'm not to worried about the cost of either cpus.

NormandySa,1664357345,xq7zz1,True,"Hi, so for the last 4 months or so I started building my first PC and I managed to get all the parts I wanted. The only part remaining is the GPU. At first, I wanted to go with 6700 XT but then the price difference between it and 6800 XT is marginal so I thought I should get it instead. 

However, as you know the new RX 7000 series is around the corner and the are way powerful than the 6000 series so I'm getting cold feet to make the purchase of 6800 XT now. 

For reference, my goal is to play some open-world games on 1440  above 60 FPS which the 6800 XT can handle easily, and to stream on Twitch for fun. Furthermore,  I'm a professional photographer and a data analyst, and I do some light video editing.

One more thing my laptop can't handel my day-to-day task that easily my office programs are lagging and shutting off by themselves. So my need of a powerful machine that can do these task fast.


So what do you think should I wait and maybe lose a good deal on the 6800 XT now for GPUs that didn't come out yet and If it does last year's situation with the insane price and availability could repeat itself?

Orkootah,1664409029,xqsc6z,True,"I've been hearing a good deal of talk regarding how these generations of CPUs/GPUs are quite expensive and seem to not offer much value. 

I personally agree, and I feel the cause of this phenomena is this:

The Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 Series GPUs, and even RTX 30 series GPUs do almost everything most people need at very affordable prices. Most people have all their needs met by a $700 RX 6900XT or a \~$750 3080ti. Ryzen 5000 offers great performance for most workstation needs and for most gamers, who likely play at up to 1440p 144hz. 

I cannot speak for the RX 7000 cards as I have no idea what they will be like, but currently, AMD and Nvidia are doing a bad job of offering greater value and new features with their new launches. Most people can do everything they need to do with older CPUs and GPUs, and with economic situations worsening globally and a flood of older CPUs/GPUs and associated price cuts, a premium pricing strategy is anything but wise.

Like it or not, Intel is quite wise this release cycle of CPUs, offering DDR4/motherboard backwards compatibility which drastically cuts adoption costs, as well as offering quite good performance for the price, with some lower end CPUs beating out the 5800X3D in gaming. That said, you can expect higher power consumption and more cooling needs, but I think most people would rather take that over having to pay hundreds of dollars more for DDR5 and more expensive motherboards. 

The Ryzen 5000, Radeon 6000 series, and RTX 30 series already launched as such powerful and good products, that they already met and will meet computational and gaming needs of people for some time to come. This is yet another instance of companies releasing products with such good value and performance, that they cannibalize future sales. 

TL;DR Ryzen 5000 CPUs, Radeon 6000 GPUs, and RTX 30 series GPUS offer such good performance, most people don't need to upgrade, making Ryzen 7000 CPUs and RTX 40 GPUs a hard sell due to superfluous performance in most instances of computational needs.",Amd,Law of Diminishing Returns - The Phenomena Plaguing New CPU/GPU Launches
matthewv1998,1664408869,xqsa2j,True," 

Hello! this is kind of a report/PSA/Review on Ryzen 7000 series. i work in the R&amp;D dept of a SI, with my position i get to work with hardware on a scale not many reviewers get to deal with, and i have discovered some findings that i am now allowed to share after a month or so.

So Ryzen 7000 is out, and 95C is the new normal. or so it seems 95C bothered us, a lot as it makes putting a good cooler on a cpu hard, to impossible when everything says its 95. This started when sticking a 7600x on a Arctic 420 AIO, an AIO that should cool a 7600x by a LOT.

So, some brainwaves later. if we cant get temps, we should be able to tell when the cpu is properly throttling if we cram a shitty enough cooler on it.

all 4 cpus were tested with Cinebench on a 10-minute burn, clock speeds were recorded and scores per cooler

So, overall. while the chips say they run at 95, some of them have a clear happy place. while cpus like the 7600X seems fairly happy on ANYTHING on it.

The 7700x is happy with anything with 4 pipes and a 120mm fan, so hyper 212 fans rejoyce.

Both the 7900x and 7950x are happy with any proper large tower cooler or good aio.

i'd personally recommend a good air cooler for 7600x, 240 aio or double tower cooler for a 7700x, 360 for 7900x and 420 aio for the 7950x. it never hurts to go a little overkill on the cooler and having some margin is better then bare minimum.

more notes is that ANY cooler you get MUST mount to the backplate. as now the retention bracket is what holds the backplate in place. any cooler that requires backplate removal won't work this gen.",Amd,95C Ryzen 7000 is not the whole story. Here is what i found with these chips.

Also the CPU Core voltage (SVI2 TFN) is usually around 1.2V.  


However the Ryzen master reports way lower frequencies as well as voltages. Is the reason for 3600MHz idle because the cores go to sleep and the HWInfo can't report lower then that?

[This is my response to the post above from /u/The_Countess since I felt it required a more detailed explanation.] So let's dive in! (https://www.reddit.com/r/Amd/comments/xq9fy3/seriously_this_is_a_price_to_performance/iq9w340/?context=3) 

First, let's get the record straight.

No, price-to-performance has increased, ***not*** decreased, gen-over-gen. Full stop.

Starting with platform, here's the lowdown: $700 versus $380 launch price for the same class of motherboard (ASUS Crosshair Hero series). Then add DDR5 prices which are at least $100 more than DDR4 (G.SKILL Trident series). Both put together, this means an approximate $400 total platform premium right out of the gate even before you secure your CPU. Now couple that with $120 more for the 16-core flagship Ryzen 9 7950X over the upcoming 13th Gen Raptor Lake flagship Core i9-13900K or preexisting 5950x, which is sure to see prices slashed further as 13th Gen enters the market. All tallied up at checkout, that's well over $500 more compared to a Ryzen 5950X.

How's that even a good deal? No, the 7950X is *not* some of the best price-to-performance--not even hardly! [Instead, we're getting a 45% uptick on average according to Tom's Hardware cumulative benchmarking score.](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psMFWqWHHY9cHd3NVRVRdi-1200-80.png.webp) This is downright terrible when the total platform price out of the door is up $500 especially when we consider the percentage in a moment! Now being totally fair, I don't believe that this is *quite* RTX 4000 series levels that we are seeing in the raucous GPU market. However, it's still quite bad gen-over-gen when you ordinarily see an improvement. Not so here. Not a strong showing in price-to-performance leadership there, Lisa Su.

More precisely, here are two very closely matched barebones bundles with equivalent lines of products for the motherboard and RAM. One bundle is for a Ryzen 9 5950X and the other bundle after it for a Ryzen 9 7590X. Both price lists come from NewEgg and were effective as of today, September 28th, 2022.

All told, we're paying 51% more for only 45% more multicore performance.

Not worth it.

That's not even considering the higher cooling and power requirements either. These have potential additional costs as well depending on the current state of your current setup. Besides the threat of 13th Gen next month, this disappointment in price-to-performance is the other obvious reason we are not seeing units flying off the shelves like we did with Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series. [In checking online, US-based Micro Center still has hundreds of units of the 7950X in stock a day later *nationwide* across their retail locations.](https://www.microcenter.com/product/652681/amd-ryzen-9-7950x-raphael-am5-45ghz-16-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included) If that doesn't scream ho-hum for what was the previously virally popular Ryzen line, I don't know what else does. This was never the case with either of the two previous product launches, the Ryzen 9 3950X or Ryzen 9 5950X. In those cases, we saw people quite literally camping out the day before and units selling out within hours on release day.

I totally loved my Ryzen 9 5950X. Man, what a technical tour de force! Now, however, even with lipstick thickly and elaborately spread on this silicon pig by AMD's PR team, I'm calling it like I see it.

uzzi38,1664365780,xqak61,True,"So I have a 6700XT, and I wanted to test XeSS with regards to performance to see what it's like. Tested both at native 1440p (high settings, but maxing out settings didn't see any significant performance impact compared to native?)

Preset (1440p High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 124fps
Ultra Quality | 108fps
Quality | 119fps
Balanced | 129fps
Performance | 139fps

In terms of quality, both Ultra Quality and Quality modes looked good. I couldn't really find issues with UQ mode by just watching the built-in benchmark, which is a massive positive. I could just start to see small amounts of ghosting on very specific objects at Quality mode, alongside the occasional shimmer and moire effect it struggled with, but honest this was still a very acceptable image. If only they actually increased framerate over native I'd have no qualms in recommending them.

Balanced and Performance modes... the issues I mentioned above all are more noticeable. At 1440p I couldn't recommend either due to the poor performance scaling. I do think both images are overall worse than native, even if balanced is only slightly so for the majority of cases. 

Well, next thing I tried was 4K via VSR. I won't be discussing image quality here because VSR isn't going to look like native 4K - it will always look worse, and I don't want that skewing my opinion. I mostly tested this to see if increasing the cost to render each frame made the relatively high frametime cost of XeSS look a lot better, and it did - now almost all presets improve framerate over native:

Preset (4K High) | Performance
------|-----------
Native | 53fps
Ultra Quality | 51fps
Quality | 59fps
Balanced | 65fps
Performance | 72fps

Here I could actually recommend the quality setting honestly. Judging by the quality at native 1440p the quality at native 4K would almost certainly look good and it's just ever so shy of the 60fps mark on average. Although it still probably would be best to reduce some settings.

Tuned_Out,1664362303,xq9fy3,True,"Or don't if you already have.

AM5 motherboards are an insult and you shouldn't consider it, even as an early adopter.

How many of you are using 3xx boards from first gen AM4 to power 3000 or 5000 series CPUs?

Answer: 1% or none. Because in many cases, you can't. And in all cases, you shouldn't. 3xx motherboards were also ""meh"" but at least they weren't this overpriced. You may be making a mistake buying this first gen AM5 platform now...and why...the cost to performance on 5000series and alderlake is insanely better.

These new boards are not future proofing anything for a new platform and you're insane if you think they will. You're going to want a proper motherboard to utilize these new features properly when the next series comes out...but hey spend $500+ now for a board that almost doesn't suck and find out the other way later. Or buy a $300 board that looks like it came straight out of a gateway pc from 2005. If ya got the money to burn, more power to ya...but for most of us, please stop and think.

They're overpriced, offer feature sets that aren't necessary, barely supported, and not optimized in any way that will make any sense until the next series of motherboards are released. Hopefully at more sane pricing when these just prove to be temporary beta boards for a new platform.

By purchasing this latest gen from either AMD or Intel, you're part of this growing price inflation problem.

Good news: 5000 series is still a beast. Prices have fallen dramatically, and their amazing performance is proven. They also have rock solid motherboard offerings. This early DDR5 still needs to fall in price and there is way more room for their speed and timings to improve. pcie 5.0 is not useful to any of us who don't plan on blowing $1600 on a Jensen hype machine, and even then...only barely.

Crypto crashing has also bottomed out video card prices.

Now is the time to be celebrating amazing pricing of previous gen and taking advantage of stellar deals. Not promoting crazy price gouging of lackluster new releases.

Okay, coffee rant over. Let the downvotes commence! &lt;3",Amd,"Seriously, this is a price to performance nightmare. Ignore this Gen and just upgrade to 5000 series if you haven't already."

NormandySa,1664357345,xq7zz1,True,"Hi, so for the last 4 months or so I started building my first PC and I managed to get all the parts I wanted. The only part remaining is the GPU. At first, I wanted to go with 6700 XT but then the price difference between it and 6800 XT is marginal so I thought I should get it instead. 

However, as you know the new RX 7000 series is around the corner and the are way powerful than the 6000 series so I'm getting cold feet to make the purchase of 6800 XT now. 

For reference, my goal is to play some open-world games on 1440  above 60 FPS which the 6800 XT can handle easily, and to stream on Twitch for fun. Furthermore,  I'm a professional photographer and a data analyst, and I do some light video editing.

One more thing my laptop can't handel my day-to-day task that easily my office programs are lagging and shutting off by themselves. So my need of a powerful machine that can do these task fast.


So what do you think should I wait and maybe lose a good deal on the 6800 XT now for GPUs that didn't come out yet and If it does last year's situation with the insane price and availability could repeat itself?
