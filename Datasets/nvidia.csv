CrimsonDurian,1664324952,xpxjl3,True,"I’ve heard a lot of people who are furious because of Nvidia’s pricing for their new GPUs. Some people are saying that they will no longer buy GPUs from Nvidia because of this and will instead buy the new Radeon GPUs. Do you think that this will affect the RTX 40 series’ sales and do you think that this anger is justified? I personally believe that this anger will eventually die out and some of if not most of the people who said that will end up buying  GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia’s sales will probably be ok. Also, I’m not sure if this anger is justified or not. The RTX 4080 12GB and 4090 are only $100 more than the last generation and that’s because of inflation (use an inflation calculator and convert $800 of 2020 money to 2022 money. It will end up being more than $900). The RTX 4080 16GB’s pricing is a little bit weird, though (its pricing makes it look more like an RTX 4080 TI). But, the main thing people are mad about is the RTX 4080 12GB being a rebranded 4070. First of all, we don’t know if this is true (but I do personally believe that this theory is correct). The RTX 4080 12GB might as well have been originally planned to be a 4080 (but because of mountains of evidence, this is probably untrue). Either way, you do have to admit that these cards are pretty powerful. What do you guys think?",nvidia,Do you think that people will stop buying Nvidia GPUs?

Recently Windows 11 released an HDR/SDR calibration app, which fixed the dull SDR issue.  Using this to create a color profile prevents the need to always turn off HDR whenever you aren’t needing it.

Weird thing is I’m now noticing my GPU (3090Ti FE) is pulling 90-99 watts at idle with HDR, vs 24-25 watts at idle without HDR on.  This causes temps to rise that the GPU won’t stay in zero fan mode at idle.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

CrimsonDurian,1664324952,xpxjl3,True,"I’ve heard a lot of people who are furious because of Nvidia’s pricing for their new GPUs. Some people are saying that they will no longer buy GPUs from Nvidia because of this and will instead buy the new Radeon GPUs. Do you think that this will affect the RTX 40 series’ sales and do you think that this anger is justified? I personally believe that this anger will eventually die out and some of if not most of the people who said that will end up buying  GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia’s sales will probably be ok. Also, I’m not sure if this anger is justified or not. The RTX 4080 12GB and 4090 are only $100 more than the last generation and that’s because of inflation (use an inflation calculator and convert $800 of 2020 money to 2022 money. It will end up being more than $900). The RTX 4080 16GB’s pricing is a little bit weird, though (its pricing makes it look more like an RTX 4080 TI). But, the main thing people are mad about is the RTX 4080 12GB being a rebranded 4070. First of all, we don’t know if this is true (but I do personally believe that this theory is correct). The RTX 4080 12GB might as well have been originally planned to be a 4080 (but because of mountains of evidence, this is probably untrue). Either way, you do have to admit that these cards are pretty powerful. What do you guys think?",nvidia,Do you think that people will stop buying Nvidia GPUs?

Weird thing is I’m now noticing my GPU (3090Ti FE) is pulling 90-99 watts at idle with HDR, vs 24-25 watts at idle without HDR on.  This causes temps to rise that the GPU won’t stay in zero fan mode at idle.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

CrimsonDurian,1664324952,xpxjl3,True,"I’ve heard a lot of people who are furious because of Nvidia’s pricing for their new GPUs. Some people are saying that they will no longer buy GPUs from Nvidia because of this and will instead buy the new Radeon GPUs. Do you think that this will affect the RTX 40 series’ sales and do you think that this anger is justified? I personally believe that this anger will eventually die out and some of if not most of the people who said that will end up buying  GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia’s sales will probably be ok. Also, I’m not sure if this anger is justified or not. The RTX 4080 12GB and 4090 are only $100 more than the last generation and that’s because of inflation (use an inflation calculator and convert $800 of 2020 money to 2022 money. It will end up being more than $900). The RTX 4080 16GB’s pricing is a little bit weird, though (its pricing makes it look more like an RTX 4080 TI). But, the main thing people are mad about is the RTX 4080 12GB being a rebranded 4070. First of all, we don’t know if this is true (but I do personally believe that this theory is correct). The RTX 4080 12GB might as well have been originally planned to be a 4080 (but because of mountains of evidence, this is probably untrue). Either way, you do have to admit that these cards are pretty powerful. What do you guys think?",nvidia,Do you think that people will stop buying Nvidia GPUs?

Weird thing is I’m now noticing my GPU (3090Ti FE) is pulling 90-99 watts at idle with HDR, vs 24-25 watts at idle without HDR on.  This causes temps to rise that the GPU won’t stay in zero fan mode at idle.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

Some people are saying that they will no longer buy GPUs from Nvidia because of this and will instead buy the new Radeon GPUs. Do you think that this will affect the RTX 40 series’ sales and do you think that this anger is justified? I personally believe that this anger will eventually die out and some of if not most of the people who said that will end up buying  GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia’s sales will probably be ok. Also, I’m not sure if this anger is justified or not. The RTX 4080 12GB and 4090 are only $100 more than the last generation and that’s because of inflation (use an inflation calculator and convert $800 of 2020 money to 2022 money. It will end up being more than $900). The RTX 4080 16GB’s pricing is a little bit weird, though (its pricing makes it look more like an RTX 4080 TI). But, the main thing people are mad about is the RTX 4080 12GB being a rebranded 4070. First of all, we don’t know if this is true (but I do personally believe that this theory is correct). The RTX 4080 12GB might as well have been originally planned to be a 4080 (but because of mountains of evidence, this is probably untrue). Either way, you do have to admit that these cards are pretty powerful. What do you guys think?",nvidia,Do you think that people will stop buying Nvidia GPUs?

Weird thing is I’m now noticing my GPU (3090Ti FE) is pulling 90-99 watts at idle with HDR, vs 24-25 watts at idle without HDR on.  This causes temps to rise that the GPU won’t stay in zero fan mode at idle.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream
CrimsonDurian,1664324952,xpxjl3,True,"I’ve heard a lot of people who are furious because of Nvidia’s pricing for their new GPUs. Some people are saying that they will no longer buy GPUs from Nvidia because of this and will instead buy the new Radeon GPUs. Do you think that this will affect the RTX 40 series’ sales and do you think that this anger is justified? I personally believe that this anger will eventually die out and some of if not most of the people who said that will end up buying  GPUs from Nvidia. Nvidia’s sales will probably be ok. Also, I’m not sure if this anger is justified or not. The RTX 4080 12GB and 4090 are only $100 more than the last generation and that’s because of inflation (use an inflation calculator and convert $800 of 2020 money to 2022 money. It will end up being more than $900). The RTX 4080 16GB’s pricing is a little bit weird, though (its pricing makes it look more like an RTX 4080 TI). But, the main thing people are mad about is the RTX 4080 12GB being a rebranded 4070. First of all, we don’t know if this is true (but I do personally believe that this theory is correct). The RTX 4080 12GB might as well have been originally planned to be a 4080 (but because of mountains of evidence, this is probably untrue). Either way, you do have to admit that these cards are pretty powerful. What do you guys think?",nvidia,Do you think that people will stop buying Nvidia GPUs?

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

SomethingNew65,1664303137,xpoj6i,True,"One week ago Digital Foundry [said](https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2022-digital-foundry-is-now-hands-on-with-rtx-4090-and-dlss-3):

&gt; We were hoping to get our full video ready for today but having already  sunk a full weekend into it, we're not done yet and need some extra time 

...

&gt; We'll be aiming to cover these topics and more in broad strokes our  content coming later this week but for now at least, the trailer above  should give you some idea of the quality level of DLSS 3 and some of the  tests we've been running. 

...

&gt; Expect to see the final piece go live later this week. 

Later this week made me think it would be out by Friday, or maybe the weekend, but now it is the Tuesday of the following week. So it seems like it is taking longer than they thought. Anyone have any theories on what might be taking so long?   


I would have expected this to be a high priority to release and get lots of clicks from since they seem to be the only place Nvidia gave an early card and permission to talk about it, so it would be a hot exclusive.   


You might say that doing a detailed analysis of DLSS 3 is just something that would take a long time, searching hours of game footage frame by frame to find any and all flaws. But if it is just a preview in the ""broad strokes"", they don't really have to analyze it for a long time like they will in the final review. I assumed it would just be more of a first impressions video talking about what's relatively easy to see. (And I'm sure Nvidia would prefer it if the preview they allowed to build hype didn't search too hard looking for flaws, and I assume they get final say over what can be in this video)",nvidia,Anybody else wondering why Digital Foundry's RTX 4000 preview hasn't released yet?

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.

1. This analysis is based on the performance number on [Nvidia's charts](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/ada/news/rtx-40-series-graphics-cards-announcements/geforce-rtx-40-series-gaming-performance.png) utilizing the 3 games without DLSS. **The games are: Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and The Division 2**
2. I will take the minimum and maximum uplift vs 3090 Ti across these 3 games
3. These are **PURE RASTERIZATION ONLY**. No DLSS, RT, or anything like that.
4. I did similar napkin math a couple years ago for 3080 vs prior generation and the number comes in within 5-10% of final benchmarks.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

Any other observations feel free to comment!

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Since a few months ago, everytime I put the computer to sleep or reboot, games will not run at their correct framerates unless I reinstall my GPU drivers. For example, this machine is for sim racing, and in ACC, I'm always getting 100+ frames, but after turning the computer on, it will get 20-30. Same with F1.

Troubleshooting:
-Rollback
-Reinstalls
-Changing power settings
-Fresh install with safemode and DDU, Geforce Experience no longer installed

Prior to a few months ago, my computer never did this. I believe it was introduced by a Geforce Experience update, and I haven't been able to get rid of it ever since.

Strangely, my other computer had this issue too, and it was resolved with the safemode DDU fresh install. But that didn't help here. Anyone have any ideas? I hate having to reinstall drivers everytime I want to play a racing game.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Upon testing it with MODS / MATS 455.127, I can see write errors on 8 out of 10 memory modules.

Now I will probably return the card, but does it make sense to try out my luck with some other cards from mining? How damaged are these cards on average? What is your experience/diagnostics results with used 3080s from mining?",nvidia,What is an average state of RTX 3080 from mining?

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong?

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

Any other observations feel free to comment!

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Since a few months ago, everytime I put the computer to sleep or reboot, games will not run at their correct framerates unless I reinstall my GPU drivers. For example, this machine is for sim racing, and in ACC, I'm always getting 100+ frames, but after turning the computer on, it will get 20-30. Same with F1.

Troubleshooting:
-Rollback
-Reinstalls
-Changing power settings
-Fresh install with safemode and DDU, Geforce Experience no longer installed

Prior to a few months ago, my computer never did this. I believe it was introduced by a Geforce Experience update, and I haven't been able to get rid of it ever since.

Strangely, my other computer had this issue too, and it was resolved with the safemode DDU fresh install. But that didn't help here. Anyone have any ideas? I hate having to reinstall drivers everytime I want to play a racing game.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Lol, ok, kinda immature.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

Any other observations feel free to comment!

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong?

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.

This analysis is based on the performance number on [Nvidia's charts](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/ada/news/rtx-40-series-graphics-cards-announcements/geforce-rtx-40-series-gaming-performance.png) utilizing the 3 games without DLSS. **The games are: Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and The Division 2**
2. I will take the minimum and maximum uplift vs 3090 Ti across these 3 games
3. These are **PURE RASTERIZATION ONLY**. No DLSS, RT, or anything like that.
4. I did similar napkin math a couple years ago for 3080 vs prior generation and the number comes in within 5-10% of final benchmarks. 
5. Since this is first party benchmark numbers, please take this with grains of salt. **This is just for fun while we wait for actual benchmarks**
6. Please Wait for Benchmarks
7. Wait for Benchmarks

First, we need to determine what these uplifts are. Based on my ""totally scientific"" (just kidding) line-drawing methodology, this is what I get. 

|**vs 3090 Ti Performance** |**Min**|**Max**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|RTX 4080 12GB|0.9x (Resident Evil Village)|0.99x (The Division 2)|
|RTX 4080 16GB|1.15x (The Division 2)|1.2x (Resident Evil Village)|
|RTX 4090|1.5x (AC Valhalla)|1.7x (Resident Evil Village)|

These numbers came in relatively close to what [this other person sees](https://twitter.com/SkyJuice60/status/1572288601781866498?s=20&amp;t=okQhIy1RAK0gdOTEpfeIgA)

Next, I grabbed the 4K average FPS figure from Techpowerup review of RTX 3090 Ti FE [here](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-founders-edition/31.html). Direct link to the 4K table [here](https://tpucdn.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3090-ti-founders-edition/images/average-fps_3840-2160.png)

Below is the summarized table starting from RTX 2070 and up along with its Launch MSRP.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

Any other observations feel free to comment!

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/).

* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

For example, this machine is for sim racing, and in ACC, I'm always getting 100+ frames, but after turning the computer on, it will get 20-30. Same with F1.

Troubleshooting:
-Rollback
-Reinstalls
-Changing power settings
-Fresh install with safemode and DDU, Geforce Experience no longer installed

Prior to a few months ago, my computer never did this. I believe it was introduced by a Geforce Experience update, and I haven't been able to get rid of it ever since.

Strangely, my other computer had this issue too, and it was resolved with the safemode DDU fresh install. But that didn't help here. Anyone have any ideas? I hate having to reinstall drivers everytime I want to play a racing game.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.

It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

I have decided to build a new top dog PC. I am going to go with a RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 7900x-950x CPU. I am debating whether I should liquid cool the CPU and GPU in a custom loop or use an AIO on my CPU and air cool the GPU. Does the 4090 expel extensive heat that air-cooling can't  handle? Will I thermal throttle my GPU? I am looking forward to water-cooling yet I see how much more expensive it is and it is an area I can save money. What would you guys advise?

Lol, ok, kinda immature.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

peacenattress,1664200562,xok02f,True,"I'm busy bilding a PC, and I'm looking at my GPU options. I am looking in the RTX 3060ti- RTX 3070ti range currently, and looking second hand locally.  I am looking an Nvidea because a program I use doesn't support AMD GPUs.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to. 

Thanks for the help.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.

It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

I have decided to build a new top dog PC. I am going to go with a RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 7900x-950x CPU. I am debating whether I should liquid cool the CPU and GPU in a custom loop or use an AIO on my CPU and air cool the GPU. Does the 4090 expel extensive heat that air-cooling can't  handle? Will I thermal throttle my GPU? I am looking forward to water-cooling yet I see how much more expensive it is and it is an area I can save money. What would you guys advise?

Lol, ok, kinda immature.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

peacenattress,1664200562,xok02f,True,"I'm busy bilding a PC, and I'm looking at my GPU options. I am looking in the RTX 3060ti- RTX 3070ti range currently, and looking second hand locally.  I am looking an Nvidea because a program I use doesn't support AMD GPUs.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to. 

Thanks for the help.

Having Issues with your driver? Read here!

**Before you start - Make sure you Submit Feedback for your Nvidia Driver Issue**

There is only one real way for any of these problems to get solved, and that’s if the Driver Team at Nvidia knows what those problems are. So in order for them to know what’s going on it would be good for any users who are having problems with the drivers to [Submit Feedback](https://forms.gle/kJ9Bqcaicvjb82SdA) to Nvidia. A guide to the information that is needed to submit feedback can be found [here](http://nvidia.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3141).

**Additionally, if you see someone having the same issue you are having in this thread, reply and mention you are having the same issue. The more people that are affected by a particular bug, the higher the priority that bug will receive from NVIDIA!!**

**Common Troubleshooting Steps**

* Be sure you are on the latest build of Windows 10 or 11
* Please visit the following link for [DDU guide](https://goo.gl/JChbVf) which contains full detailed information on how to do Fresh Driver Install.
* If your driver still crashes after DDU reinstall, try going to Go to Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Managed 3D Settings -&gt; Power Management Mode: Prefer Maximum Performance

If it still crashes, we have a few other troubleshooting steps but this is fairly involved and you should not do it if you do not feel comfortable. Proceed below at your own risk:

* A lot of driver crashing is caused by Windows TDR issue. There is a huge post on GeForce forum about this [here](https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/413110/the-nvlddmkm-error-what-is-it-an-fyi-for-those-seeing-this-issue/). This post dated back to 2009 (Thanks Microsoft) and it can affect both Nvidia and AMD cards.
* Unfortunately this issue can be caused by many different things so it’s difficult to pin down. However, editing the [windows registry](https://www.reddit.com/r/battlefield_4/comments/1xzzn4/tdrdelay_10_fixed_my_crashes_since_last_patch/) might solve the problem.
* Additionally, there is also a tool made by Wagnard (maker of DDU) that can be used to change this TDR value. [Download here](http://www.wagnardmobile.com/Tdr%20Manipulator/Tdr%20Manipulator%20v1.1.zip). Note that I have not personally tested this tool.

If you are still having issue at this point, visit [GeForce Forum for support](https://forums.geforce.com/default/board/33/geforce-drivers/) or contact your manufacturer for RMA.

**Common Questions**

* **Is it safe to upgrade to &lt;insert driver version here&gt;?** *Fact of the matter is that the result will differ person by person due to different configurations. The only way to know is to try it yourself. My rule of thumb is to wait a few days. If there’s no confirmed widespread issue, I would try the new driver.*

**Bear in mind that people who have no issues tend to not post on Reddit or forums. Unless there is significant coverage about specific driver issue, chances are they are fine. Try it yourself and you can always DDU and reinstall old driver if needed.**

* **My color is washed out after upgrading/installing driver. Help!** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel -&gt; Change Resolution -&gt; Scroll all the way down -&gt; Output Dynamic Range = FULL.*
* **My game is stuttering when processing physics calculation** *Try going to the Nvidia Control Panel and to the Surround and PhysX settings and ensure the PhysX processor is set to your GPU*
* **What does the new Power Management option “Optimal Power” means? How does this differ from Adaptive?** *The new power management mode is related to what was said in the Geforce GTX 1080 keynote video. To further reduce power consumption while the computer is idle and nothing is changing on the screen, the driver will not make the GPU render a new frame; the driver will get the one (already rendered) frame from the framebuffer and output directly to monitor.*

Remember, driver codes are extremely complex and there are billions of different possible configurations. The software will not be perfect and there will be issues for some people. For a more comprehensive list of open issues, please take a look at the Release Notes. Again, I encourage folks who installed the driver to post their experience here... good or bad.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

peacenattress,1664200562,xok02f,True,"I'm busy bilding a PC, and I'm looking at my GPU options. I am looking in the RTX 3060ti- RTX 3070ti range currently, and looking second hand locally.  I am looking an Nvidea because a program I use doesn't support AMD GPUs.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

It's weird because what happens is that Shadowplay will tell me that they saved the last 5 mins, but when I go check the file location of where my clips usually are and I can clearly see that no video file has been made.
Has anyone experienced this before?
To reiterate, yes I have tried to reinstall, I have tried to turn the software on and off again, I have also tried to do different binds + go into the overlay to press save the recording. nothing I've tried seems to work and it frustrates me because I don't know any other program that works like shadowplay.
anyways lmk if you guys have a potential fix for this.

thanks

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Lol, ok, kinda immature.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?

5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

It seems in my current situation while playing the game my gpu hits 90% and one of my cpu cores is hitting like 60-80% usage? 

As a noob I thought I probably need to upgrade my GPU but other people keep saying this game is CPU heavy so I need a CPU upgrade. What do you guys think? 

Best of both worlds is upgrading both cpu and gpu but that ain't in the budget.

It's either a RTX 3060ti and new psu or a 5600x as an upgrade option. 

Maybe my gpu and cpu are pretty balanced together and just upgrading 1 thing won't help me much?

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

I have decided to build a new top dog PC. I am going to go with a RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 7900x-950x CPU. I am debating whether I should liquid cool the CPU and GPU in a custom loop or use an AIO on my CPU and air cool the GPU. Does the 4090 expel extensive heat that air-cooling can't  handle? Will I thermal throttle my GPU? I am looking forward to water-cooling yet I see how much more expensive it is and it is an area I can save money. What would you guys advise?

Lol, ok, kinda immature.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?

5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to. 

Thanks for the help.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

I have decided to build a new top dog PC. I am going to go with a RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 7900x-950x CPU. I am debating whether I should liquid cool the CPU and GPU in a custom loop or use an AIO on my CPU and air cool the GPU. Does the 4090 expel extensive heat that air-cooling can't  handle? Will I thermal throttle my GPU? I am looking forward to water-cooling yet I see how much more expensive it is and it is an area I can save money. What would you guys advise?

Lol, ok, kinda immature.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

peacenattress,1664200562,xok02f,True,"I'm busy bilding a PC, and I'm looking at my GPU options. I am looking in the RTX 3060ti- RTX 3070ti range currently, and looking second hand locally.  I am looking an Nvidea because a program I use doesn't support AMD GPUs.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking?

-Rollback
-Reinstalls
-Changing power settings
-Fresh install with safemode and DDU, Geforce Experience no longer installed

Prior to a few months ago, my computer never did this. I believe it was introduced by a Geforce Experience update, and I haven't been able to get rid of it ever since.

Strangely, my other computer had this issue too, and it was resolved with the safemode DDU fresh install. But that didn't help here. Anyone have any ideas? I hate having to reinstall drivers everytime I want to play a racing game.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

peacenattress,1664200562,xok02f,True,"I'm busy bilding a PC, and I'm looking at my GPU options. I am looking in the RTX 3060ti- RTX 3070ti range currently, and looking second hand locally.  I am looking an Nvidea because a program I use doesn't support AMD GPUs.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

peacenattress,1664200562,xok02f,True,"I'm busy bilding a PC, and I'm looking at my GPU options. I am looking in the RTX 3060ti- RTX 3070ti range currently, and looking second hand locally.  I am looking an Nvidea because a program I use doesn't support AMD GPUs.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

-Fresh install with safemode and DDU, Geforce Experience no longer installed

Prior to a few months ago, my computer never did this. I believe it was introduced by a Geforce Experience update, and I haven't been able to get rid of it ever since.

Strangely, my other computer had this issue too, and it was resolved with the safemode DDU fresh install. But that didn't help here. Anyone have any ideas? I hate having to reinstall drivers everytime I want to play a racing game.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

This analysis is based on the performance number on [Nvidia's charts](https://images.nvidia.com/aem-dam/Solutions/geforce/ada/news/rtx-40-series-graphics-cards-announcements/geforce-rtx-40-series-gaming-performance.png) utilizing the 3 games without DLSS. **The games are: Resident Evil Village, Assassin's Creed Valhalla, and The Division 2**
2. I will take the minimum and maximum uplift vs 3090 Ti across these 3 games
3. These are **PURE RASTERIZATION ONLY**. No DLSS, RT, or anything like that.
4. I did similar napkin math a couple years ago for 3080 vs prior generation and the number comes in within 5-10% of final benchmarks. 
5. Since this is first party benchmark numbers, please take this with grains of salt. **This is just for fun while we wait for actual benchmarks**
6. Please Wait for Benchmarks

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

Any other observations feel free to comment!

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

Randomizer23,1664203887,xolh7w,True,"So I plan to replace my thermal pads and paste on my card, and I have a couple questions. So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

1. I am debating between Kryonaut and Syy 157 for the core not sure which to go with.
2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?
3. Should I buy multiple packs of 1mm, 2mm, 3mm and cut them myself? What do I need to cut them with to be precise?
4. Should I go with a predetermined thermal pad kit for my specific card?
5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

So to preface, my card runs at around 70c max when running superposition, mem temps reached 94c. When I remove my side panel on my 570x the core drops to 66c and mem drops to 88c. This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded. So I have a couple questions regarding the whole process.

2. What brand of pads should I get? What kind of thermal conductivity?

5. Is it worth adding an extra thermal pad on the right side of the die on the vram modules? I read that there should be one there from factory but there isnt. I just dont want it to prevent proper contact with the GPU die as I game so ideally both vram and core temps would come down.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to.

Nestledrink,1664253851,xp6qqq,True,"**This is a straight copy/paste post taken from**: [https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/forums/geforce-graphics-cards/5/501736/geforce-rtx-40-series-power-specifications/)

Since announcing the GeForce RTX 40 Series we’ve seen an uptick in questions about power and whether your existing systems are compatible.

GeForce RTX 40 Series does not require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations (more below). The graphics cards come with a power adapter to ensure compatibility with existing power supplies. We have rigorously tested the power adapters across a wide range of conditions.

Answers to common questions are below, including PSU wattage recommendations for each card, the lifetime number of reconnections, and more.

### Common Questions about RTX 40 Series Power Supply Compatibility

**Do I need to upgrade my PSU for the RTX 40 Series?**

The RTX 40 Series doesn’t require a new power supply if you already meet the PSU wattage recommendations. The RTX 4090 TGP is 450 W and the minimum recommended PSU is 850 W. The 4080 16GB TGP is 320 W with a minimum recommended power supply of 750W, and the minimum recommended power supply for the 4080 12GB is 700W.

**How do GeForce RTX 4090 and 4080 power requirements compare to last generation?**

The power requirements have stayed the same or reduced while delivering substantially more performance. RTX 4090 draws the same power as RTX 3090 Ti, the RTX 4080 16GB draws 30W less than RTX 3080 Ti, and the RTX 4080 12GB draws 65W less power than RTX 3080 12GB.

**Do the RTX 40 Series cards require a new type of power connector or a new power cable?**

No. The RTX 40 Series cards come with power adapters that allow you to use existing power supplies with existing 8-pin PCIe connectors. The RTX 40 Series cards can also use the PCIe Gen5 power connector which allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable.

**If the RTX 40 Series cards can use the existing connectors and power supplies, then why change to a new connector standard?**

The PCIe Gen5 power connector is the new standard for PCIe add-in-card power. The standard allows you to power the graphics card with a single cable, which simplifies cable routing and improves airflow inside the chassis, among other benefits.

**PCI-SIG warned of potential overcurrent/overpower risk with 12VHPWR connectors using non-ATX 3.0 PSU &amp; Gen 5 adapter plugs. Why did PCI-SIG issue the warning and how does this affect NVIDIA’s new products?**

It does not affect NVIDIA’s new products. During early development and testing we identified a potential issue with a prototype connector manufactured from a sole supplier. As a PCI-SIG member, we informed the supplier, asked them to fix it (which they did), and shared our findings to help suppliers who are implementing the new standard. The PCI-SIG was passing along those learnings to other suppliers.

**Why is there only a 30 cycle lifetime on these new PCIe Gen 5 connectors?**

The 30 cycle spec is the same as it’s been for the last 20+ years on existing PCIe/ATX 8pin connectors, and has not changed with the PCIe Gen5 connectors or power adapters.

**Are the RTX 40 Series Adapters “smart” enough to interface with a ATX 2.0 PSU and appropriately regulate the power to the GPU?**

Yes. The adapter has active circuits inside that translate the 8-pin plug status to the correct sideband signals according to the PCIe Gen 5 (ATX 3.0) spec.

**What’s a ‘smart’ power adapter?**

The adapter has an active circuit that detects and reports the power capacity to the graphics card based on the number of 8-pin connectors plugged in. This enables the RTX 4090 to increase the power headroom for overclocking when 4x 8-pin connectors are used versus 3x 8-pin connectors.

**If I bend the RTX 40 Series adapter will it cause issues with the connection between my PSU and GPU?**

The adapter has been proven to work in a wide variety of conditions. Please follow our compatibility diagram: plan a minimum of 1.4” or 36mm clearance above the top of the graphics card for cable bend and airflow clearance.

**Should I be concerned if my PSU only has one power rail available to connect my graphics card (i.e. only have 1 power connection available)?**

Please connect the original power supply output connectors and cables directly to the included power adapter. Power supplies typically only supply up to 2x 8pin PCIe connectors per output cable. RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 16GB require at least 3x 8pin PCIe connectors or a 450W or greater PCIe Gen 5 connector.

kb3_fk8,1664236651,xp09x7,True,"Just saw a post on here about a guy with a 1440p monitor and people are saying that he's not getting 4k to his gamestream. 

I recently (like 8 months ago) switched to 4k panels but before that I had two 1440p monitors. I would start the game in moonlight (via steam app) and then I would be able to select the 4k resolution from the in game settings. Not all games played nice with this though. 

So out of curiosity, I just hooked up my old 1440p monitor, started up Horizon that started in 1440p, selected 4k as the resolution and the game resized itself visibly on the TV. The text became smaller, the picture was less grainy and when I went back to my main monitor, selected what resolution it was running windows in and it was 4k. It even looked like it was super sampled on my monitor. 

So my question is this: if windows says it's 4k, the game says it 4k, moonlight says it's 4k, then where's the disconnect here. The only thing I can think of is that Gamestream API forces DSR, even way back before it was an option in the NVCP, and it was never explained to me this way. 

Sitting in front of my TV right now and switching Deep Rock Galactic from 1440p to 4k back and forth and it's VERY NOTICEABLE, my wife commented on the cleaner picture. 

It means little to me now that I have 4k screens but I would still like an explanation on what's going on, if I am wrong then what exactly is the Gamestream API doing to make the picture better looking? 

Edit: Used the 1440p mode on my PS5 in some games and put it back to 4k and the picture was very similar in change compared to what's happening in Moonlight. Have a 1 year old so I'm typing as I'm playing around, sorry for the typos.",nvidia,So quick question about 4k Moonlight/Gamestream

Strangely, my other computer had this issue too, and it was resolved with the safemode DDU fresh install. But that didn't help here. Anyone have any ideas? I hate having to reinstall drivers everytime I want to play a racing game.

When i got my computer the shadowplay saved all different game clips in their each folder, i changed something bc i created a file in my new hard drive so i could save the clips there and now all the clips go to that one specific file instead of their folders (example: i recorded desktop and it would save in the desktop folder, now i record desktops footage and tbh i dont know where it goes and i can only see it, for now, in the alt+r menu, how can i change it back/ reset the folder choice from geforce?",nvidia,can someone help me with shadowplay?

I have decided to build a new top dog PC. I am going to go with a RTX 4090 and a Ryzen 9 7900x-950x CPU. I am debating whether I should liquid cool the CPU and GPU in a custom loop or use an AIO on my CPU and air cool the GPU. Does the 4090 expel extensive heat that air-cooling can't  handle? Will I thermal throttle my GPU? I am looking forward to water-cooling yet I see how much more expensive it is and it is an area I can save money. What would you guys advise?

Lol, ok, kinda immature.

All I really said was that I do not believe the 4070 was going to be much better than the 3080. And I said I don't believe benchmarks will show Nvidia 4090 will be 2x more than 3090, unless they resort to DLSS for those numbers. They did do just that lmao.  


Not every game has DLSS, but let's move past that.  
It turns out I was generally correct. The ""fake/scammy"" 4080 12gb is basically a 4070 but since they named it 4080 and not 4070, it means when they do launch an even weaker 4070, it will be much lower than the 3090 performance making my statement correct.   


The 4070 will be about 3080 performance lmao. Idk what is more disappointing. That they removed my post? That the 4080 12gb is really a 4070? Or that the 4070 coming soon will actually be even worse?

# Some observations

* Nothing that hasn't been said before on the subreddit but RTX 4090 looks to be the ""superstar"" SKU of Ada Lovelace generation. It seems to provide substantial performance improvement for pretty similar pricing (+$100) to RTX 3090 before it. Similar parallel can be drawn with RTX 3080 performance and price in relations to RTX 2080 before it.
* RTX 4080 16GB looks to be the ""true"" gen over gen successor of RTX 3080 but its cost increase (1.72x) negated the appeal of its performance increase
* If we view 4080 16GB from the lens of ""80 Ti class"" GPU, then it looks to provide approx 1.3x performance for the same price ($1,199) vs 3080 Ti.
* RTX 4080 12GB can be viewed 2 ways
   * As an 80 class GPU, it is providing around 1.1x-1.22x more performance vs 3080 at 1.29x the cost
   * As an 70 class GPU, it is providing 1.44x-1.58x more performance vs 3070 at 1.8x the cost.
* I suspect that Nvidia is calling it ""RTX 4080"" to avoid price comparison with RTX 3070 because that's a steep increase in price (1.8x) despite its healthy performance improvement (approx 1.5x). Unfortunately comparing it with 3080 also shows a relatively weak generational improvement (1.1x-1.22x) for its cost increase (approx 1.3x). It's a lose-lose situation because 3080 was a really strong SKU in terms of performance and price last generation.

ArdentTake,1664221045,xotdpe,True,"Someone else posted this on PCMasterRace but I am having the exact problem word for word so I thought I'd repost it here to see if anybody else might have some fixes

I've been using Nvidia's recording functionality for years now (I know it used to be called Shadowplay; I don't believe they're officially using that name anymore though), across multiple GPUs. Suddenly, today, it's just a big nope.

I can open the Overlay, change various settings, turn my mic input on or off, but cannot record anything. Whether I use keyboard shortcuts or open the overlay and manually click on the commands, I cannot manually record or capture an instant replay, nor even turn the instant replay function on or off.

About an hour ago, I installed the latest drivers (516.94) and restarted my PC. For about 20 mins, everything seemed normal; I took a short recording to test it and it seemed fine. Turned instant replay back on and loaded up Control (a game I played a ton of last year and recorded several videos of) and played for a bit... then when I opened the overlay, the problem was back again.

Interestingly, I could not turn instant replay OFF when it was already on, while playing Control. So the issue seems to be with the overlay itself, I guess? But, after about 10 minutes of repeatedly trying to start a recording or turn replay off, it just turned off by itself. Naturally, after that point, I then couldn't turn it back on, and still can't record.

I have the Desktop Capture option enabled, as I also sometimes use the overlay to record non-game stuff and have never had an issue doing so until today (the problems are the same whether a game is running or not). A PC restart does seem to fix it but only for a few minutes, then it breaks again.

So yeah. Pretty weird. I'm obviously on the latest graphics drivers. Anyone encounter something like this or have any idea what went wrong? Obviously one option is to completely uninstall my drivers and GeForce experience and then reinstall everything, and I'll do that if it seems necessary, but that's a bit of a pain so I thought I'd ask here first just in case.

This is with around 2100rpm on the fans with the panel off and 2200rpm with the panel on. I have 6 ll120s in my case at 1200rpm. So I figured id replace the paste and pads before swapping out my case and see what happens. I saw multiple reviews and on open air the card doesn't really go past 63c, and so, it being a used card im guessing the pads and paste have degraded.

Not sure if I need to change driver settings or is this the expected outcome.

peacenattress,1664200562,xok02f,True,"I'm busy bilding a PC, and I'm looking at my GPU options. I am looking in the RTX 3060ti- RTX 3070ti range currently, and looking second hand locally.  I am looking an Nvidea because a program I use doesn't support AMD GPUs.

I currently live using solar electricity, and so power usage is a pretty big concern. 

The problem I'm facing is that there is a 3070ti deal I have my eye on, but I've seen on PC Part Picker that there is a 90W difference between the usage of an RTX 3060ti and an RTX 3070ti (RTX 3070 falls somewhere in the middle). That's a pretty huge dfifference, and at night/during bad weather it will limit me a lot. 

**My first question is**: Is it possible to undervolt/limit the power usage of my GPU enough to bridge the wattage difference between the RTX 3060ti and RTX 3070ti (90W)? It seems like it makes more sense to just get an RTX 3060ti, but I do want to have the power of the 3070ti on hand for daylight/sunshine hours. I am not worried about losing performance at all, because wattage matters more in those situations. 

**My second question is**: If it *is* possible to undervolt the 3070ti by 90 watts, how much further could I reliably expect to go? I know it varies card by card, but I just want an idea of the least possible wattage I could get to if I needed to. 

Thanks for the help.

Now for 3 generations we are faking 4k with down sampling and it comes at a cost that my eyes can't but notice.

I can't stand dlss even in quality mode, the fizzy wiggly lines you get, the ghosting with small moving objects.

And now dlss 3.0 is going to add fake frames, I'm sure some remember when TVs use to claim 240hz. Everyone just turns that off as we all know it makes the image look terrible.
